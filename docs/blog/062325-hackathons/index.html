  <h1>Hackathons. 10 years later.</h1>
  <p style="color:#aaa; font-size:0.9em;">2025-06-23</p>

    <p>I thought hackathons were over.</p>
<p>In 2015, as a creative developer at Audible/Amazon, my team of six won a nationwide hackathon. We created a web app player for Audible using Facebook/Meta’s React, a new technology at the time. We quickly prototyped and built a production model within 72 hours.</p>
<p>We also created “plugins” within the web app. Obsessed with the Philips Hue/Zigby SDK, I created an applet that synced children’s storybooks to the lighting system. After a day of research, testing, and debugging, I had a working model. Whenever a color or nature reference was mentioned, the lights shifted gradients and brightness to visualize the story in the user’s room.</p>
<p>We celebrated our accomplishment and hoped Audible/Amazon would release the project.</p>
<p>The next day, we were informed that the judges who voted for our entry were let go. Amazon didn’t want our project to proceed.</p>
<p>Ten years later, I’m applying to another hackathon.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m excited to build in the digital space after working analog as a baker for the last four years.</li>
<li>I’ve adopted the latest tools to optimize process and cost efficiency, like React did in 2015.</li>
<li>I’m working alone (and with a chatbot with Bolt/Claude/CoPilot).</li>
</ul>
<p>A friend in cyber-security told me about Bolt. His team made an app in 4 hours, which his lead developers took 7 months to make.</p>
<p>I’m amazed by my rapid progress in creating apps with the AI Chatbot apps. My developer knowledge helps, but the ability to conceptualize and launch apps is shocking.</p>
<p>Before, I outsourced back-end engineers and had a 50% success rate. Now, with a Supabase database and a Netlify site, I’ve created a recipe book, a Bitcoin DCA predictive dashboard, and a personal website for my mom’s business. It took only 8 hours of actual work and 15 prompts/manual code editing.</p>
<p>The “10x Developer” theory with AI is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software development is more creative and less mentally taxing.</li>
<li>Not everyone needs to code; everyone needs to convey ideas.</li>
<li>Products and companies have a shorter life cycle: creation to valuation to expiration.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m still working a full-time job, but debugging, finding broken dependencies, and perfecting the design and interaction experience are gone.</p>
